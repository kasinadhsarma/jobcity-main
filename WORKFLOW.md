   cd jobcity
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Committing Changes
1. Create a new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```
2. Make your changes and stage them:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```
4. Push your changes:
   ```
